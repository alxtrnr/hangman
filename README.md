# hangman

A terminal based app. The traditional hangman word guessing game with an api look up and some data plots. A coding exercise for practise and learning **Python**. Topics include use of modules, API requests, error handling, matplotlib, numpy. Add to that creating a github project where code review and contributions are invited. 

1. An English word is generated. Parameters for random (word) may be set in the script.
2. Player has 11 tries to guess the word
3. Gallows / noose advances for every wrong guess
4. Wikipedia entry based on the word along with definitions of the word is diplayed when word is guessed or no guesses left.
5. A message is displayed if word guessed is in the top 5000 most used English words.
6. Player may choose to see graphical depiction of word / letter data (matplotlib tables)
7. Game loops to start

Contributions are welcomed. See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/alxtrnr/hangman/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how.

Code / project review would be great! Bit muddled about returning and passing values between functions. Any pointers on this or anything else would be wonderful. Thank you.
